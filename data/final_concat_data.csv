Commonly in the prior art, the micro-perforated membrane is designed to retain the liquid in the atomizing chamber behind the membrane and contain its static pressure. The balance of the pressures, the shape of the holes and the nature of the material used for the membrane is such that the liquid does not seep out of the membrane and that no ""dripping"" or liquid loss phenomenon occurs. Moreover, the dome shape provides for a better distribution of the micro-droplet or aerosol mist by causing the jet to diverge by simple geometrical effect. Also, the vibratory speed associated with the displacement of the membrane makes it possible to eject the micro-droplets through the holes. In the case of the present invention, the dimensions of the dome and of the micro-perforated membrane are such that the dome provides a vibratory motion amplification effect while retaining a vibratory speed distribution that is uniform over the surface of the membrane. Unlike in the prior art, the membrane does not affect the vibratory behavior of the transducer. Whatever the thickness of the membrane (for example from 20 to 200 μm), the piezoelectric member retains its dynamic characteristics and its vibratory performance. More specifically, the resonance frequency and the vibratory displacements of the transducer are not modified by the mechanical coupling of the membrane. This gives the atomizer advantages in as much as the transducer (frequencies, vibratory displacements, deformation modes, coupling coefficient and mechanical quality factor) can be designed without taking into account the membrane (geometry and material).
This property of the present invention advantageously makes it possible to optimize the structure of the transducer (or converter) in order to favor either the aerosol output speed, or the throughput, or the resonance frequency, or the consumption or the efficiency of the transducer. In this way, it is possible to produce vibrating membrane atomizers that allow aerosols to be produced at almost zero speed (medical application) up to ejection speeds for example of the order of 30 m/s (cosmetic application). Similarly, the atomization throughput is no longer directly linked to the surface area of the piezoelectric ceramic but to the length of the piezoelectric transducer making it possible to adapt throughputs from 1 μl/s to 300 μl/s. It is this same length that directly governs the resonance frequency of the atomizer. The atomizer operating mode is not a flexing mode but a longitudinal elongation mode. This makes it possible to work at high frequencies (50 to 200 kHz) with piezoelectric ceramics of small diameter without compromising the liquid throughput and above all with very low losses. These mechanical losses which correspond to an energy that is dissipated in heat in the transducer increase strongly according to the operating frequency of the transducer. In the present invention, the latter are reduced because the efficiencies of the longitudinal-transducer-type structures are far better than the ""bimetallic strip"" type structures that operate by flexing.
The low losses in the transducer lead to the design of atomizers with low electrical consumption. This advantage is considerable in as much as the atomizers of the prior art are limited in their application by the atomization time and the lifetime of the power supply cells or batteries. In practice, the advantageous applications of the vibrating micro-perforated membrane atomizers mainly relate to ""hand-held"" devices operating on cells or batteries. The structure that is the subject of the present invention is less damped by the liquid behind the membrane. This property provides for less heating of the liquid to be atomized. In the applications in which the atomizers deliver medical formulations, heating of the liquid can be prohibitive and greatly limit the benefit of such atomizers.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

US9533343,219,they are very expensive and highly sensitive to catalyst poisons,seam-welded tube and extruded seamless tube are expensive,0.87,US09533291,C,US09533343,F,"Vehicle manufacturers are implementing lighter, stronger materials, such as aluminum alloys to meet emission reduction goals, meet fuel economy goals, reduce manufacturing costs, and reduce vehicle weight. Increasingly demanding safety standards must be met while reducing vehicle weight. One approach to meeting these competing interests and objectives is to hydro-form high strength aluminum alloy tubular blanks into strong, lightweight hydro-formed parts.
Aluminum tube types include seam-welded tube, extruded seamless tube, and extruded structural tube. Seam-welded tube and extruded seamless tube are expensive. Extruded structural tubes are lower in cost because they are formed in a continuous mill operation having a greater line and material utilization efficiency than extruded seamless tubes and seam-welded tubes.
Extruded structural tubes are formed by extruding an aluminum billet through an extrusion die at a high temperature and at high pressure. Discontinuous material flow across the section of the shape occurs when the flowing aluminum separates in the mandrel plate and re-converges in the cap section. A weld line, or joining line, is created where the flowing aluminum re-converges to form the extruded shape. Extruded structural tubes may have two or more weld lines that are an artifact of the porthole extrusion process.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
US9533376,319,the molecular weight of a polymer may vary,deposits of single materials may or may not benefit significantly from planarization,0.86,US09532955,A,US09533376,B,"Some embodiments will add one or more multi-material layers to the sheet or sheets of material to form enhanced structures. The multi-material layers may be formed by one or more of the processes as set forth in the patents, patent applications, or other publications set forth in the table above. In some embodiments these multi-material, multi-layer structures will be formed on the sheet material or formed separately and then bonded to the sheet material. When forming a first multi-material layer on a sheet of material, an adhesion layer (e.g. W—Ti, Cu, or Au) having a thickness of the order of 1s to 10s to 100s of nanometers) may be initially deposited by sputtering, PVD, or the like as necessary. Next, a seed layer may be deposited (e.g. Cu, Au, Ni, or the like) may be deposited by sputtering, PVD or electroless deposition as necessary. Alternatively, if the original adhesion layer is adequate, a strike deposition may be used to provide an activated surface for receiving subsequent electrodeposited material. Thereafter, a first material may be pattern deposited via openings in a photolithographically fabricated mask, pattern deposited via openings formed by direct ablation of a masking material, patterned deposited via a direct selective deposition process. After deposition of one or more materials as part of a given layer, a subsequent material forming part of the given layer may be deposited in a patterned manner or blanket manner into a mold of previously deposited material or materials. After deposition of all or part of the materials forming a given planarization operations (e.g. lapping, fly cutting, CMP, other machining, or the like) may be used to smooth planarized the surface, set an orientation for the surface and in in the end to set a final thickness for the given layer. In such embodiments, one of two deposited materials is generally a sacrificial material while the other is a structural material. Basic processes for such formation are set forth in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,027,630 and 5,190,673. In more advanced embodiments, where more than two materials form part of a given layer (exclusive of seed layers and adhesion layers) one or more of the deposited materials are structural materials and one or more are sacrificial materials. In some advanced processes, interlacing of materials deposited in association with specific layers occurs and may provide enhanced adhesion or strengthening of interlayer bonds. Examples of such processes are found in U.S. Pat. No. 7,252,861 which is incorporated herein by reference. Such multi-material deposits may be made over sheets, or sheets with deposited material, that already contains laser cut patterns such that the subsequently deposited material or materials not only lay on the top or bottom surfaces of the sheet material or on top or bottom surfaces of other deposited materials but also are located on the sides of the cut regions.
In some embodiments, deposited material for a layer might be in the form of a single material as opposed to being in multi-material form. Such deposits of single materials may or may not benefit significantly from planarization. Such deposits of single materials may take on desired patterns by subsequent laser cutting or ablation. Such deposits may be made over sheets, or sheets with deposited material, that already contains laser cut patterns such that the subsequently deposited material or materials not only lay on the top or bottom surfaces of the sheet material or on top or bottom surfaces of other deposited materials but also are located on the sides of the cut regions.
FIG. 1A provides a sample listing of some materials that may be used in various combinations in the various method embodiments of the invention. In some embodiments all such materials may be used, in other embodiments only a portion of the materials may be used. In some embodiments, some materials may be used multiple times. Some such materials may form part of the structure while other materials may be separated from the structures (e.g. probes) prior to putting them to use (i.e. these might be considered sacrificial materials and reuseable materials such as substrates, bases, frames, and the like).

US9533538,220,thinner adhesive coatings are more desirable for a number of reasons including less cost and more efficient use of adhesive,having to maintain a high initial static pressure is undesirable for a number of reasons,0.87,US09534100,C,US09533538,F,"The most common type of shock absorbers for automobiles are the dashpot type in which a piston is located within a pressure tube and is connected to the sprung mass of the vehicle through a piston rod. The piston divides the pressure tube into an upper working chamber and a lower working chamber. Because the piston, through valving, has the ability to limit the flow of damping fluid between the upper and lower working chambers within the pressure tube when the shock absorber is compressed or extended, the shock absorber is able to produce a damping force which counteracts the vibrations which would otherwise be transmitted from the unsprung mass to the sprung mass. In a dual tube shock absorber, a fluid reservoir is defined between the pressure tube and a reserve tube which is positioned around the pressure tube. A base valve is located between the lower working chamber and the fluid reservoir to also produce a damping force which counteracts the vibration which would otherwise be transmitted from the unsprung portion to the sprung portion of the automobile during stroking of the shock absorber.
A conventional monotube shock absorber typically includes highly pressurized hydraulic fluid because its ability to dampen vibrations is limited by the initial static pressure of the hydraulic fluid. Having to maintain a high initial static pressure is undesirable for a number of reasons. A monotube shock absorber configured to operate at a lower pressure, thus reducing friction at the seals, would therefore be desirable. A monotube shock absorber that does not experience excessive noise caused by cavitation would also be desirable. Furthermore, methods and devices for securing a fixed valve assembly within a tube of a monotube shock absorber would be desirable.

The combination of the mean flow pore size and thickness determines the flow rates through the membranes. For microfiltration applications, an appropriate flow rate is required, together with good particle retention performance. A narrow ePTFE pore size leads to high water entry pressures. A larger ePTFE pore size would decrease the resistance of an ePTFE membrane to water entry. For these practical reasons, a mean flow pore size of ePTFE below 0.3 micrometer is regarded as being favorable.

Known EC reservoirs have typically been rigid. They are a pressure vessel and therefore require a sealed compartment with tubing ports adding to costs. A gas, typically air, is introduced through a sterile barrier, generally a membrane filter, to control pressure in the vessel. Fluid level control has been limited to ultrasonic, conductive or optical trip points, or by a load cell measuring the weight of the fluid. Reservoirs are expensive and difficult to manufacture. There is limited EC fluid level measurement accuracy—ultrasonic, conductive or optical monitoring of fluid levels are commonly fouled by cell debris in the reservoir. Alternatively, load cells are not a rugged design for reliable fluid level sensing.

This is particularly the case in embodiments wherein each of the different composition nanoparticles is included in a host material that is the same for each of the different nanoparticles.
Examples of preferred host materials for inclusion in particles for use in a formulation (e.g., that is useful to prepare a coating) include hydrocarbon wax, which is available in different molecular weight versions.

In comparison, water has viscosity less than 1 cp. Using a steam 116 and hot gas 117 layer embodiment, having an insulating layer 119, heat Q is now effectively transferred to the heavy oil formation of the upper zone 110. At steam condensation temperatures, the heavy oil viscosity can drop many orders of magnitude and into the hundreds or tens of centipoise, being recoverable using known production well techniques. As heavy oil mobility in the heavy oil formation increases, steam continues to be effectively directed higher and to ever greater radial extent in the heavy oil formation.

US9534561,226,depositing multiple layers onto multiple substrates may require multiple processing chambers,the use of multiple fuel sources may require a fuel delivery means tuned for each fuel,0.83,US09534294,C,US09534561,F,"In one embodiment, as shown in FIG. 72, a swirler 7230 is located upstream of the venturi 7240 and advantageously creates a tangential flow of air through the venturi. As is well known in the art, the tangential flow from the swirler can create an annular vortex in the combustion chamber, which stabilizes the flame. Additionally, the swirler 7230 increases the suction pressure at the venturi throat 7244 by increasing the local air velocity over the fuel inlet ports 7279. Adding the swirler allows the venturi throat 7244 to be made larger for a given suction pressure. Furthermore, the swirling action induced by the swirler 7230 can suppress fluctuations in the combustion chamber pressure from propagating upstream to the venturi 7240. Such pressure fluctuations can temporarily slow or stop the flow of fuel gas into the venturi 7240. The swirler 7230 thereby facilitates a steady fuel-air ratio in the combustion chamber for steady airflows. The swirler 7230 may be a radial swirler.
In other embodiments, the gaseous burner can be connected to multiple fuel sources. In this configuration, the burner may be fired, lit or ignited with a type of fuel and then run with a different type of fuel. The use of multiple fuel sources may require a fuel delivery means tuned for each fuel. FIGS. 75, 75A, and 75B show embodiments for two fuels with significantly different energy densities such propane and natural gas. In this embodiment, the fuel delivery means for the denser propane must be approximately three times more restrictive than the fuel delivery means for the less dense natural gas or methane. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 75, the venturi has different manifolds and fuel ports for each fuel. High-density fuels such as propane would require the more restrictive fuel inlet ports 7279, while a low-density fuel such as natural gas would require less restrictive fuel inlet ports 7279A. This configuration retains the highest resistance to fuel flow at the venturi temperature. However, the embodiment of the venturi in FIG. 75 may be more difficult to manufacture and have a higher-pressure loss drop due to the long narrow passage.
Another embodiment for a gaseous burner with multiple fuel sources is shown in FIG. 75A. In this embodiment, a fuel selector valve 7276 directs the fuel through an additional fuel restriction such as 7278A or 7278B for a dense gas or a less dense gas respectively. The multi-port valve 7276 allows any number of predefined gases to be burned by the same burner. Predefined gases such as natural gas, liquid petroleum gas (LPG) or biogas can be burned in the same burner by simply setting a selector valve to the corresponding fuel setting. Alternatively, other embodiments can have multiple settings for different qualities of biogas as the carbon dioxide fraction in biogas can vary from 50% to 20%. The fuel restrictors may be placed outside the burner as shown in FIG. 75A or alternatively they can be located in the entrances to the manifold 7273. If restrictions 7278 are placed outside of the burner, then significant part of the fuel-delivery-means pressure drop is not at the venturi temperature and thus the fuel-air ratio may vary with the venturi temperature. The burner will run initially leaner and get progressively richer as the hotter faster air flowing through the venturi exerts a stronger vacuum on the fuel. In addition, moving a significant part of the pressure drop from the fuel ports 7279, the fuel will not penetrate as far into the air stream. Nevertheless, locating multiple restrictors 7278 for different gases may make the fabrication of the part easier.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present disclosure, it is recognized that sensor module units can be targeted or otherwise designed for a particular class of sensor applications. For example, one sensor module unit can be designed for sensor applications targeted to school buildings, while another sensor module unit can be designed for sensor applications targeted to office buildings. The sensor module unit targeted for school building use can include a set of sensors that are popular with school building sensor applications. For instance, the set of sensors can include pulse sensors for measuring utility consumption (e.g., gas, water, electricity), a temperature sensor, an air quality sensor, a humidity sensor and a light sensor. The sensor module unit targeted for school building use can then be selected for installation with wireless nodes deployed in school buildings. In this manner, a relatively generic sensor module unit can be deployed across many sensor application deployments in various schools without requiring full customization for a specific application at a particular school. Production costs of the sensor module units are thereby minimized without any loss of flexibility in deploying customized sensor module units.
The impact on economies of scale can be readily appreciated. Wireless node modules can be produced on a larger manufacturing scale because the generic wireless nodes can be applied in many types of monitored locations in a manner that is separate from the particular sensor objectives at the particular monitored location.

Pins or probes are applied to the lands or pads and signals are sent or received through the pins to test the die. For a more complex die, more pins are used. Similarly for denser circuitry on the die, the pins are closer together.
The test probes are attached to a substrate that holds each probe in the proper position with respect to each other probe so that when the tester is pressed against the pads on the die, each probe will contact its respective pad. The probes are resilient so that when the probes are pressed against the die the pressure of the contact is determined by the resiliency of the probe, not the pressure of from the test equipment. Each test probe has a limited number of die tests that it can perform, after which it must be replaced. The replacement cost of each test probe is therefore a factor in the cost of die manufacturing.

Center frequency 606 is configured to the expected frequency of signal 605 when signal 605 is operating normally, and signal distortion rejection bandwidth 608 is typically set to a large value such as 600-800 radians/second to prevent distortion factors in the sag determination. The center frequency can be fed in real time by a frequency detection device such as a phase locked loop. Following the processing by signal distortion rejection tracking filter 610, the signal distortion rejection filtered signal is passed to adder 640.

Center frequency 606 is set to the expected frequency of signal 605, and signal memory bandwidth 607 is set to a bandwidth in the initial or recovering state to determine when signal 605 transitions to a sag state.

In the initial or recovering state, when signal 605 is operating normally, the output of signal distortion rejection tracking filter 610 minus the output of signal memory tracking filter 615 should yield a result that is at or around zero. In contrast, if signal 605 has dropped to a sag state, the output of signal distortion rejection tracking filter 610 minus the output of signal memory tracking filter 615 should yield a result that is farther removed from zero.

As referred to herein, failure diagnostics are meant to assist the field engineer with troubleshooting of telemetry systems by testing components separately in order to detect the origin and type of failure. Failure diagnostics (e.g., EDTS 2.0) can be divided into eWAFE self-tests (i.e, detecting eWAFE module failures), logging cable tests facilitated by eWAFE and Enhanced Digital Telemetry Cartridge (EDTC-H)—detecting if wires of the multiconductor cable have a failure, EDTC-H self-tests—hardware health checks normally performed before the telemetry training starts, and EFTB 2.0 toolbus self-tests. The tests can further narrow the source of a problem to a particular tool in the tool string. The results are displayed on a screen (e.g., MAXWELL™ window). A detailed report can be logged for initial auto-diagnosis phase and successive diagnosis sessions run by user.
Link performance monitoring and management (e.g., using EDTS 2.0) provides detailed monitoring of both cable telemetry link quality, as well as toolbus link quality using, for example, uplink and downlink cable telemetry physical layer performance indicators, cable telemetry data layer performance indicators, and toolbus data layer performance indicators.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When the weather based control strategy is utilized, the EMC system 100 receives weather data 102 as an additional input, and uses this additional data to implement set-points.

Utilization of the load shifting control strategy may result in the savings of energy cost.

Determining how the data is relocated from one data storage tier to another is a complex issue, and it involves many factors, such as, storage efficiency, data reliability, performance, effort required to re-encode data, and overall cost involved in the data relocation.

If synchronization was unnecessary for that specific execution, execution can commit without any cross-thread serialization. If the processor cannot commit atomically, then the optimistic execution fails. When this happens, the processor will roll back the execution, a process referred to as a transactional abort. On a transactional abort, the processor will discard all updates performed in the memory region used by the transaction, restore architectural state to appear as if the optimistic execution never occurred, and resume execution non-transactionally.
A processor can perform a transactional abort for numerous reasons. A primary reason to abort a transaction is due to conflicting memory accesses between the transactionally executing logical processor and another logical processor. Such conflicting memory accesses may prevent a successful transactional execution. Memory addresses read from within a transactional region constitute the read-set of the transactional region and addresses written to within the transactional region constitute the write-set of the transactional region. Intel TSX maintains the read- and write-sets at the granularity of a cache line. A conflicting memory access occurs if another logical processor either reads a location that is part of the transactional region's write-set or writes a location that is a part of either the read- or write-set of the transactional region. A conflicting access typically means that serialization is required for this code region. Since Intel TSX detects data conflicts at the granularity of a cache line, unrelated data locations placed in the same cache line will be detected as conflicts that result in transactional aborts. Transactional aborts may also occur due to limited transactional resources. For example, the amount of data accessed in the region may exceed an implementation-specific capacity. Additionally, some instructions and system events may cause transactional aborts. Frequent transactional aborts result in wasted cycles and increased inefficiency.

Products are available which allow users to create applications that process and query streaming data before it reaches a database file. With this emerging technology, users can specify processing logic to apply to inbound data records while they are ""in flight,"" with the results available in a very short amount of time, often in fractions of a second. Constructing an application using this type of processing has opened up a new programming paradigm that will allow for development of a broad variety of innovative applications, systems, and processes, as well as present new challenges for application programmers and database developers.
In a stream computing application, stream operators are connected to one another such that data flows from one stream operator to the next (e.g., over a TCP/IP socket). When a stream operator receives data, it may perform operations, such as analysis logic, which may change the tuple by adding or subtracting attributes, or updating the values of existing attributes within the tuple. When the analysis logic is complete, a new tuple is then sent to the next stream operator. Scalability is achieved by distributing an application across nodes by creating executables (i.e., processing elements), as well as replicating processing elements on multiple nodes and load balancing among them. Stream operators in a stream computing application can be fused together to form a processing element that is executable. Doing so allows processing elements to share a common process space, resulting in much faster communication between stream operators than is available using inter-process communication techniques (e.g., using a TCP/IP socket). Further, processing elements can be inserted or removed dynamically from an operator graph representing the flow of data through the stream computing application. A particular stream operator may not reside within the same operating system process as other stream operators. In addition, stream operators in the same operator graph may be hosted on different nodes, e.g., on different compute nodes or on different cores of a compute node.
Data flows from one stream operator to another in the form of a ""tuple."" A tuple is a sequence of one or more attributes associated with an entity. Attributes may be any of a variety of different types, e.g., integer, float, Boolean, string, etc. The attributes may be ordered. In addition to attributes associated with an entity, a tuple may include metadata, i.e., data about the tuple. A tuple may be extended by adding one or more additional attributes or metadata to it. As used herein, ""stream"" or ""data stream"" refers to a sequence of tuples. Generally, a stream may be considered a pseudo-infinite sequence of tuples.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As shown in FIG. 4, for each event received in the event stream, overlapping partition adapter 200 can determine a list of participating processing nodes for the object identified in the event (blocks 402, 404). As discussed above, this determination can be carried out by passing the position of the object to sparse partitioner 202 of FIG. 2. Sparse partitioner 202 can then use the object's position to perform a search (e.g., an Rtree index search) of processing nodes whose spatial region covers the object's position.
Upon receiving the list of participating processing nodes from sparse partitioner 202, overlapping partition adapter 200 can iterate through all of the processing nodes in the system and determine whether a given node is a participating node (e.g., is in the list returned by sparse partitioner 202) (blocks 406, 408).

US9535804,301,most affected people are otherwise healthy and of a healthy weight when onset occurs,if a memory error occurs when loading a word of a cache line,0.89,US09533002,A,US09535804,G,"FIG. 2 is a diagram that illustrates the recursive re-creation of data words in some embodiments. In the example of FIG. 2, a check group 200 represents a resilient segment that has 16 data words forming a 4-by-4 matrix of the check group with 4 row check units and 4 column check units. The asterisk within a cell of the matrix indicates that a memory error is encountered when loading from the data word of that cell. For example, because cell (0,0) contains an asterisk, an attempt to load from the data word of that cell will result in a memory error. In contrast, because cell (0,1) has no asterisk, the data word of that cell will be loaded without a memory error. An application program may execute a load instruction to load the data word of cell (3,2) (e.g., the target address) into a target register. If so, the memory system will report a memory error and control will be passed to the re-create data word component of the resiliency system. The resiliency system may initially attempt to re-create the data word of cell (3,2) by loading the other data words and the check word of the row check unit that contains cell (3,2), that is, the check unit of row 3. In this example, the asterisk in cell (3,3) indicates that a memory error occurs when loading the data word of that cell. So the resiliency system attempts to re-create the data word of cell (3,3) using the check unit of column 3. In this example, the resiliency system encounters another memory error when loading cell (1,3) of the check unit of column 3. The resiliency system then attempts to re-create the data word of cell (1,3) using the check unit of row 1. The resiliency system then encounters another memory error when loading cell (1,1) of the check unit of row 1. The resiliency system then attempts to re-create the data word of cell (1,1) using the check unit of column 1. The resiliency system then encounters another memory error when loading the data word of cell (2,1) of the check unit of column 1. The resiliency system then attempts to re-create the data word of cell (2,1) using the check unit of row 2. The resiliency system will encounter another error when loading the row check word for the check unit of row 2. The resiliency system, in this example, cannot re-create a check word because the resiliency system does not store error correction information for check words. As a result, the attempt to re-create the data word of cell (3,2) starting with the check unit of row 3 was unsuccessful. The resiliency system then attempts to re-create the data word of cell (3,2) in the other direction starting with the check unit of column 2. The resiliency system encounters a memory error when loading the data word of cell (0,2) of the check unit of column 2. The resiliency system then attempts to re-create the data word of cell (0,2) using the check unit of row 0. The resiliency system then encounters a memory error when loading the data word of cell (0,0) of the check unit of row 0. The resiliency system then attempts to re-create the data word of cell (0,0) using the check unit of column 0. Since all the other data words and the check word for the check unit of column 0 can be loaded without memory error, the resiliency system re-creates the data word of cell (0,0). The resiliency system then re-creates that data word of cell (0,2) using the re-created data word of cell (0,0) and finally re-creates the data word of cell (3,2) using the re-created data word of cell (0,2) and stores that re-created data word in the target location of the load instruction. In some embodiments, each memory error encountered when attempting to re-create a data word results in a recursive invocation of components of the resiliency system unless it is determined that a certain memory error cannot be corrected (at least in a certain direction).
Memory systems typically load an entire cache line of memory locations into a cache when a load instruction is executed that accesses any one of the memory locations within the cache line and the cache line is not currently cached. For example, if a cache line contains eight words, then the memory system will load memory locations 0-7 upon execution of a load instruction for any one of locations 0-7, memory locations 8-15 upon execution of a load instruction for any one of locations 8-15, and so on. If a memory error occurs when loading a word of a cache line, some memory systems may have a memory error flag for each word of the cache line to identify the word(s) to which the memory error(s) applies. Some memory systems, however, only have memory error flags (also referred to as non-specific memory error signals) for groups of words in a cache line, referred to as a memory error unit. For example, a memory system may have only one memory error flag for the cache line (only one memory error unit) or have one memory error flag for the first half of the cache line (a first memory error unit) and a second memory error flag for the second half of the cache line (a second memory error unit).
When a memory error unit has multiple words, the resiliency system is unable to determine whether the data word that was the target of a load was loaded correctly or not. So the resiliency system attempts to re-create that data word by loading the other data words of the check unit. If, however, another data word of the check unit is in the same memory error unit, that check unit will have two data words with a reported memory error—although the memory error may have occurred in the other words of the memory error unit. As such, the resiliency system might attempt to re-create that other data word of the check unit. That attempt might be successful or not, but nevertheless the attempt is additional overhead that might be avoided. Moreover, the presence of multiple memory errors reduces the likelihood that the resiliency system will ultimately be able to re-create a data word. In some embodiments, the resiliency system defines check units so that no two data words of a check unit are in the same memory error unit to avoid having to handle additional memory errors from that same memory error unit when re-creating a data word. For example, if an application program defines a resilient segment with 256 data words, the resiliency system may define 16 different check groups for the resilient segment covering 16 data words each. In such a case, the resiliency system may define the first check group to include memory locations 0, 16, 32, 48, and so on of the resilient segment, the second check group to include memory locations 1, 17, 33, 49, and so on of the resilient segment, and the other check groups to include memory locations defined in a similar manner. As a result of this definition, no check group (and thus no check unit) will contain data words that would be in the same memory error unit. Although with such a definition the resiliency system would not fully benefit from cache line pre-fetching when re-creating a data word, the improved likelihood of successfully re-creating data words with such a definition would likely be a much greater benefit, especially since memory errors should occur only during a very small percentage of the loads.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

US9535858,196,the weight average molecular weight is measured by the gel permeation chromatography ( gpc ),by comparing the costs,0.8,US09534067,C,US09535858,G,"Under a same value of the amount K, as the index ix is selected closer to the number Nu and/or the index jx is selected closer to 1, more circuitry (e.g., more units U[p,.] and D[q,.]) needs to be implemented by the chip 101, less circuitry needs to be implemented by the chip 102; also, throughput via the data balls Da[1] to Da[K] and Db[1] to Db[K], as well as clock rate of the clock CK1, need to increase, because the partitioning frequency interfaces are corresponding to signals of higher sampling frequencies. To implement more circuitry in the chip 101, cost and layout overhead may increase, high-speed inter-chip connection may also increase cost; however, cost may be reduced since the chip 102 implements less circuitry which lowers layout overhead. Manufacturing technology of the chips 101 and 102 also affects cost balancing; if the chip 101 is made by advanced process of smaller process size, layout overhead to implement more circuitry may not increase too much; on the other hand, if the chip 102 is made by mature process of greater process size, effect of cost reduction may be impacted. In addition, value of the amount K affects implement cost; as the amount K increases, inter-chip connection throughput and clock rate can be lowered to reduce cost, but greater value of the amount K also increases pin-count and complexity of inter-chip wiring, thus compromises effect of cost reduction.
Although it is difficult to intuitively estimate cost to implement the signal processing system 100, costs corresponding to different selections of the partitioning frequency interfaces and the amount K can be accurately evaluated by computer. By comparing the costs, the selection which costs least can be actually adopted to implement the signal processing system 100.
Please refer to FIG. 2 illustrating a signal processing system 200 according to an embodiment of the invention. Following the architecture shown in FIG. 1, the signal processing system 200 in FIG. 2 distributes across two chips 201 and 202, and adopts three-level up-sampling for digital-to-analog and three-level down-sampling for analog-to-digital, thus the numbers Nu=Nd=3. The signal processing system 200 includes a number P of DACs DA[1] to DA[P] and a number Q of ADCs AD[1] to AD[Q]. Each converter DA[p] (for p=1 to P) includes units U[p,1] to U[p,3] for up-sampling, a DAC interface circuit IA[p] and a DAC stage DAs[p]. Each converter AD[q] (q=1 to Q) includes an ADC stage ADs[q], an ADC interface circuit ID[q] and units D[q,1] to D[q,3] for down-sampling.","['cost; as the', 'also affects cost balancing; if the chip 101 is made by advanced process of smaller process size, layout overhead to implement more circuitry may not increase too much; on the other hand,', 'more circuitry may not increase too much; on the other hand, if the chip 102 is made by mature process of greater process size, effect of cost reduction may be impacted.

Given the potential volume of computation required for this type of activity, in one embodiment, the contextual geohashing method of the present invention employs hashing methods to support the Hadoop File Systems (HDFS) and MapReduce operations for Big Data analytics.
The terms data, information, and knowledge represent three overlapping abstract concepts. Data are qualitative and/or quantitative values that typically result from some type of measurement. Data without any context is difficult to interpret. Information results from the association of context (applying meaning) with data, generally from a defined set of perspectives. Knowledge is the collective assembly of related information drawn from across multiple perspectives. In this sense, information describes what data is and where and when it is relevant. Knowledge can then be thought of why and how the information is useful.
A situational context describes a framework for interpreting data (applying meaning) as information from a defined perspective and then relating disparate information into codified knowledge. Data is transformed into information through the association of multidimensional contexts, such as where the data is located, when it is relevant, and what it represents. The normalization of these contexts is one aspect of the framework that can be used to define situational context. Another aspect of this framework is the relating or conflation of disparate information using context.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Direct cost items are usually already valuated after data collection. For example, ""$5,000 per month base salary"" is an amount and, therefore, a valuated cost item. On the other hand, ""eight overtime hours per month"" is a quantity and a non-valuated cost item that is valuated during the planning run. Set limits are used to ensure that certain specified cost items cannot exceed or fall below certain fixed values.
The cost planning specialist also can specify set limits for each scenario. These limits ensure that fixed upper or lower limits are maintained for certain cost items during the planning run. For example, the cost planning specialist can specify a set limit for pay raises of 3% over the time period encompassed by the planning run. Depending on the organizational attributes of the cost object, the set limits can be at different levels for each cost item. The cost planning specialist can provide an authorization for line managers to specify or modify set limits for the scenarios to the extent that the set limits are within the job responsibility or expertise of the particular line manager. For example, one line manager may have a staff that has lagged behind the majority of the enterprise with respect to pay raises. As such, the cost planning specialist can provide authorization for that line manager to permit a pay raise for that line manager's staff for a value greater than the 3% set by the cost planning specialist for the enterprise.

Direct cost items are usually already valuated after data collection. For example, ""$5,000 per month base salary"" is an amount and, therefore, a valuated cost item. On the other hand, ""eight overtime hours per month"" is a quantity and a non-valuated cost item that is valuated during the planning run. Set limits are used to ensure that certain specified cost items cannot exceed or fall below certain fixed values.
The cost planning specialist also can specify set limits for each scenario. These limits ensure that fixed upper or lower limits are maintained for certain cost items during the planning run. For example, the cost planning specialist can specify a set limit for pay raises of 3% over the time period encompassed by the planning run. Depending on the organizational attributes of the cost object, the set limits can be at different levels for each cost item. The cost planning specialist can provide an authorization for line managers to specify or modify set limits for the scenarios to the extent that the set limits are within the job responsibility or expertise of the particular line manager. For example, one line manager may have a staff that has lagged behind the majority of the enterprise with respect to pay raises.

One service area in particular that has been significantly impacted by the Internet is job search services. The Internet has changed the approach that many people take when performing a search for a new job. Numerous online websites are dedicated to matching job seekers with job providers. Some of the online job matching services are directed to very specific markets, for example, matching computer programmers with short-term contract work.
Nearly all online job services suffer from the same general problem. Studies have shown that more than half of all jobs and consulting contracts are found when the job applicant is personally referred to the hiring organization, as opposed to when the job applicant responds to a job posting and/or applies directly with no previous connection to the hiring organization. From the perspective of a company or other hiring organization, although only a relatively small percentage of all job candidates are referred by someone in the company or hiring organization, these referrals may account for more than half of the people hired for jobs and consulting contracts.
Generally, online job matching services work in much the same way that a traditional newspaper classifieds section works. A company may post information about a job offering to a database that is accessible via a website hosted by the company or a third-party. Accordingly, potential job candidates may browse, research, or even apply for a job posted on the website. Typically, a job posting from an online job matching service identifies the posting organization (e.g., the organization offering the job) and/or the person responsible for the posting. In some cases, a job posting may even include the name of the person making the hiring decision.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

US9536659,99,existing pipe thrusters can be very expensive and bulky,they are bulky and expensive to ship,0.82,US09534705,F,US09536659,G,"The present invention uses only very simple tooling, such as a single bobbin 20 with end flanges 22. The tooling is therefore relatively inexpensive, and relatively robust. As the same tool is used for making many coil assemblies, the present invention will produce magnets with consistent bare-magnet homogeneity between magnets.
The large, precision-machined formers conventionally used for winding magnets are expensive in material and labour cost. They can only be sourced from a few locations worldwide. They are bulky and expensive to ship. The present invention may use compression blocks made of composite materials such as resin-impregnated glass fibre, formed in-situ during impregnation of the magnet coils. Such compression blocks are very inexpensive, and being formed in situ, do not require machining, obtaining from a third-party supplier, shipping or storage. Only sufficient stock of the component parts—filler material, hardening material and hardener, if required—must be maintained. Alternatively, compression blocks, for example of extruded aluminium, may be used. These only need to be accurately machined in the axial direction. They may be produced cheaply by any one of many manufacturers. They are lightweight and require very little space when shipping. Processing of the aluminium compression blocks after extrusion consists only of milling two opposite faces for accurate axial length, and possibly hole drilling for stress relief at corners. The shape of the compression blocks in the extrusion die may be adapted to reduce stress concentrations at the edges of the blocks.
Conventional methods for assembling superconducting coils together into an inner magnet assembly typically require multiple impregnation or bonding steps, which results in long manufacturing lead-times, and increases the opportunities for damage to the coils. The present invention provides a single-step method of impregnating coils, manufacturing and attaching spacers and mechanical support structures in the form of compression blocks, significantly speeding and simplifying the manufacturing process.","['a third-party supplier, shipping or', 'third-party supplier, shipping or', 'third-party supplier, shipping', 'third-party supplier, shipping or storage.

The method according to the invention is additionally suitable for identifying shrinkage of the sample material caused by the influence of the primary particle beam. If shrinkage artifacts occur, the dose of the primary particles impinging on the sample should be reduced.
FIG. 4 shows by way of example a further advantageous embodiment of the invention. The illustration shows schematically how images of a sample block 402 are captured, wherein the sample block 402 has been trimmed obliquely on account of a microtome blade 401 not oriented exactly at right angles relative to the optical axis 403 of the particle-optical apparatus. The sample layer 404 cut off has been discarded. A suitable detector, preferably a BSE detector, is used for capturing the images. Firstly, a first image of the sample is captured, wherein the sample is scanned by the primary particle beam in a raster-type manner and the sample is scanned in a first focal plane 405. A further image of the sample is then captured, wherein the sample is scanned in a further focal plane 406, which differs from the first focal plane 405. The capture of a respective further image of the sample is repeated until an n-th image has been captured with an n-th focal plane 407, wherein the n-th focal plane 407 differs from all preceding focal planes (405, 406). Usually, at least 5 to 10, advantageously 5 to 50, focal planes are captured. All of the captured images are stored. A 3D reconstruction of the sample block is then calculated on the basis of the captured images. The angle γ which the primary particle beam running parallel to the optical axis 403 and the normal to the sample surface 408 form relative to one another can be determined on the basis of the 3D reconstruction. The angle between primary particle beam and sample surface can subsequently be corrected, such that the angle is approximately 0°. This can be done by correspondingly moving the sample and/or by correspondingly altering the focal plane of each individual image during the subsequent capture of a series of images. Angle γ should be regarded as too large and corrected if angle γ is greater than angle β. Angle β is defined as β=D/L, wherein D denotes the thickness of the sample layer cut off, while L denotes the length of the longitudinal side of the rectangular scanning field scanned by the primary particle beam. It is assumed here that tan β=β, since β assumes only small values because the distance L is usually 10 times greater, preferably 50 times greater, than the distance D. Angle γ is corrected by the sample stage being rotated about a tilting axis of the sample stage until |γ|<|β|.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The method according to the invention is additionally suitable for identifying shrinkage of the sample material caused by the influence of the primary particle beam. If shrinkage artifacts occur, the dose of the primary particles impinging on the sample should be reduced.
FIG. 4 shows by way of example a further advantageous embodiment of the invention. The illustration shows schematically how images of a sample block 402 are captured, wherein the sample block 402 has been trimmed obliquely on account of a microtome blade 401 not oriented exactly at right angles relative to the optical axis 403 of the particle-optical apparatus. The sample layer 404 cut off has been discarded. A suitable detector, preferably a BSE detector, is used for capturing the images. Firstly, a first image of the sample is captured, wherein the sample is scanned by the primary particle beam in a raster-type manner and the sample is scanned in a first focal plane 405. A further image of the sample is then captured, wherein the sample is scanned in a further focal plane 406, which differs from the first focal plane 405. The capture of a respective further image of the sample is repeated until an n-th image has been captured with an n-th focal plane 407, wherein the n-th focal plane 407 differs from all preceding focal planes (405, 406). Usually, at least 5 to 10, advantageously 5 to 50, focal planes are captured. All of the captured images are stored. A 3D reconstruction of the sample block is then calculated on the basis of the captured images. The angle γ which the primary particle beam running parallel to the optical axis 403 and the normal to the sample surface 408 form relative to one another can be determined on the basis of the 3D reconstruction. The angle between primary particle beam and sample surface can subsequently be corrected, such that the angle is approximately 0°. This can be done by correspondingly moving the sample and/or by correspondingly altering the focal plane of each individual image during the subsequent capture of a series of images. Angle γ should be regarded as too large and corrected if angle γ is greater than angle β. Angle β is defined as β=D/L, wherein D denotes the thickness of the sample layer cut off, while L denotes the length of the longitudinal side of the rectangular scanning field scanned by the primary particle beam. It is assumed here that tan β=β, since β assumes only small values because the distance L is usually 10 times greater, preferably 50 times greater, than the distance D. Angle γ is corrected by the sample stage being rotated about a tilting axis of the sample stage until |γ|<|β|.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In both instances the height of the surface of the die (the semiconductor product) to be brought into contact with the insert should be well known to provide a good contact. A die surface that is ‘too high’ will result in a too high pressure exerted by the insert member on the die, which can damage the die. A die surface that is ‘too low’ will result in not enough pressure exerted by the insert member on the surface, which will cause in flash and bleed of the encapsulation material onto the open window.

FIG. 1A shows a first step of fabricating a support 111 and a transfer object 112. It is important to fabricate them to have a desired curvature according to the purposes, particularly to fabricate the support 111 to have elasticity. The curvature radius of the support 111 after the first step is finished is defined as Ri. The row materials, material quality and shaping methods are not defined in particular. The thickness is not limited in particular as well. Typically, it is fine to have a thickness of about 100 micrometers. Generally, those having a film thickness of 200 micrometers or below are called a film, and those of 200 micrometers or greater are called a sheet. It is acceptable that the support 111 and the transfer object 112 are a film or sheet. As for the support 111, it is fine that the support is so thin that it has elasticity. Here, plastics are used for both the support 111 and the transfer object 112. With the use of general thermoplastic resins or thermosetting resins as row materials, they are shaped by general plastic molding, that is, in the course of plasticization in which a row material is heated for easy flow, shaping in which a mold is used to give a desired shape, and solidification in which the shape is stabilized by cooling or curing reaction. For example, FIGS. 2A and 2B show the steps of compression molding of a thermosetting resin. First, as shown in FIG. 2A, a thermosetting resin 212, which is heated with high flowability, is filled in a mold (female mold) 211
In addition, a coating film with various functions (not shown) can be deposited in a single layer or multiple layers over the support 111 and the transfer object 112. Generally, a barrier film for blocking water and oxygen, a base film for improving the adhesion of adhesives, and a protection layer for enhancing chemical resistance and physical strength are laminated. For example, a silicon nitride thin film having a thickness of about 100 nm can be deposited over the support 111 by sputtering. However, at least one of the support 111 and the transfer object 112 needs to have a limited light transmittance, that is, to be transparent.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Accordingly, a differential circuit or a current mirror circuit having excellent properties can be realized. In addition, a structure where gate electrodes are formed above and below a channel may be used.

The first transistor TR1 may be formed to have a gate-all-around structure. As an example, the first channel region CH1 may be a nano wire or nanotube structure having a width ranging from several nanometers to several ten nanometers. Such a structure of the first channel region CH1 may contribute to prevent a short channel effect from occurring in the first transistor TR1. Since all of the top, bottom, and side surface of the first channel region CH1 are used as a channel region of the first transistor TR1, the first transistor TR1 can have an increased channel width. In general, one way to increase an integration density of a semiconductor device is to reduce a channel width of a transistor. In this case, the transistor may suffer from a narrow channel effect. According to still other example embodiments of the inventive concept, since the first channel region CH1 has the gate-all-around structure, it is possible to relieve short and narrow channel effects of the transistor. According to the conventional art, in the case where the first transistor TR1 has a nano-sized channel, it suffers from low driving current. By contrast, according to still other example embodiments of the inventive concept, since the first channel region CH1 contains germanium of high concentration (e.g., of 60 at % or more), it is possible to increase mobility of an electric current passing therethrough. Accordingly, even when the transistor has a nano-sized channel, the transistor can have a large driving current property.

The germanium concentration of the SRB layer 110 may be higher at a portion 111 adjacent to the gap region GA than at other portions apart from the gap region GA.

US9537143,284,the racket frame was prepared without having a weight mounted thereto,design allows for a battery weight reduction,0.84,US09533198,A,US09537143,H,"U.S. Pat. No. 5,296,261 describes a method for producing a sponge metal made from nickel, copper or lead using a polymer sponge as a template which is impregnated with a solution of nitrite or sulfate of the metal. The object of the invention was to create a microporous metal structure for use as an electrode in portable alkaline storage cells. No reference is made to the electrochemical or corrosion protection of such an electrode in a highly oxidizing and corrosive environment, as is present in a lead-acid battery, nor is there any reference to the coating of such a metal substrate with any active materials.
U.S. Pat. No. 6,232,017 describes a lead-acid battery grid design that reduces the total weight of the battery by providing for an electrode grid comprising a reticulate made of an organic or inorganic compound (i.e. a sheet of glass fibers). Such a design allows for a battery weight reduction, especially for the negative electrode. A lead or lead alloy electricity collecting part covers part of the reticulate, where the grid can be covered with a thin film of a lead alloy on the reticulate surface.
U.S. Pat. No. 6,617,071 teaches a method whereby the battery plate is covered with a conductive polymer which is then coated with nanoscale particles of active material. Such design serves to reduce the weight of the battery and minimize positive grid corrosion. The design provides for the substantial utilization of the active material, as the nanoparticles are entrained and held within the conductive polymer skeleton and provide a large surface area for reaction. The conductive polymer has a rigid porous structure to promote the diffusion of acid and ionic species, but is still able to act as a ""spring"" during charging/discharging as the active materials change volume. However, the disclosed approach still requires a grid plate having at least one surface. Further, the conductive polymer skeleton limits the size of the active particles held therein to ""nanoscale size"", thereby greatly limiting the mass of held particles, and thus the energy density of this design. The small size of the porous polymer structure limits the diffusion of the acid and ionic species, with the potential of the particles clogging the nano-sized pores during the discharge cycle, thereby limiting the rate of charge/discharge. Additionally, since the nanoparticles are added to the polymer after it is polymerized on the battery grid, the depth to which the nanoparticles can be entrained is greatly limited by the nano-sized pores within the polymer.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

US9537230,129,these failings may severely limit the flexibility of operation of an scm,damage to an electrical cable may impair operation of the cable,0.85,US09533905,C,US09537230,H,"The subject matter described and/or illustrated herein relates generally to electrical cables.
Electrical cables are widely used for interconnecting components that are spaced apart from each other. Some typical examples of electrical cables include coaxial cables, triaxial cables, twin axial cables, and quadrax cables. Electrical cables may be nicked, cut, severed, abraded, and/or otherwise damaged during use. For example, an electrical cable may be cut or completely severed by a relatively sharp object. Electrical cables can also be completely severed by blunt objects that exert enough force to snap the cable. Abrasion may result from an electrical cable rubbing against a neighboring object. A kink is yet another example of cable damage. Damage to an electrical cable may impair operation of the cable. For example, damage to an electrical cable may interrupt the electrical paths of the cable such that the electrical cable is no longer capable of conveying data signals between the components.
When some known electrical cables are damaged, the cable is replaced instead of being repaired. For example, electrical cables that include more than two electrical conductors, that include conductors arranged concentrically, and/or that carry relatively high data rates (e.g., data rates above approximately 0.5 gigabits per second (Gbit/s)) are replaced instead of being repaired. Such electrical cables are replaced, instead of being repaired, because a repair will change the electrical properties of the cables. For example, an electrical cable that has been repaired may experience a change in the impedance of the cable along the location of the repair. Such a change in impedance may cause the electrical cable to experience signal losses, unwanted reflections, and/or the like along the location of the repair.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

US9537329,14,but such consideration is not appropriate,but such increase is short in time,0.8,US09536574,G,US09537329,H,"A simple, 2 string battery pack in which each string has only 4 cells for simplicity is shown on FIG. 6 for the balancing mode of operation. As can be seen on FIG. 6, the battery capacity goes from 4.4 Ah to 8.8 Ah and the waveforms shown on FIG. 4 essentially stay the same.
In a vehicle application the power demand can rise very quickly, but such increase is short in time. Nevertheless, such high load current events are detrimental to the life expectancy of the battery. In such application the use of super capacitors is beneficial in that the capacitors supply the short duration high current demand and greatly reduces the stress on the batteries. Since super capacitors are only available with low voltage ratings, 2.5-4.5V, they are connected in parallel with each cell and look like an extra string of battery cells. Super capacitors are routinely used in demanding applications and their use is fully compatible with the battery management circuit. They improve the overall system performance because batteries, when they are close to being fully discharged and have only 15-20% of their capacity left, normally exhibit a higher internal resistance. A sudden high current demand will lower the cell voltage and may temporarily trigger the low battery condition to be detected and activate the battery management circuit. Having the super capacitors supply the extra current prevents a false alarm indicating a low battery condition. However, when a cell is almost completely discharged, retaining only 3-5% of its capacity, the terminal voltage drops on a permanent basis which cannot be compensated for by the super capacitors and then the battery management circuit is activated providing the necessary voltage balancing of the cells.
In another set of embodiments, a mixture of the shunt transistor of FIG. 1 and the balancing circuitry of FIG. 2 can be used. An example is illustrated in FIG. 7. In the example of FIG. 7 there are 4 groups of batteries, each having 4 cells. The balancing circuit can balance the groups but not the individual cells. This circuit has only four secondary windings, one for each of the groups, yet it balances 16 batteries. The shunt transistors are passive during discharge. When the voltage across any group drops below a predetermined level, the switching transistor is activated and the voltage on the weak group will be held up by the battery management circuit.","['lower the cell voltage and may', 'lower the cell voltage and may temporarily trigger the low battery condition to be detected and activate the battery management circuit.

Such implanted medical devices would only be energized when the ECA is providing energy to the secondary coil, however, such an embodiment would likely be used where the implanted medical device was used infrequently.
Some of the exemplary embodiments discussed above have emphasized PCM materials that act as a heat sink as the material transitions from a solid to a liquid. It should be recognized that materials transitioning from a liquid to a gas or vapor, or from a solid to a gas or vapor, could also be used as a heat sink, so long as the temperature associated with the phase change was in the desired range. Such materials function as a heat sink due to the latent heat of vaporization, rather than the latent heat of fusion. As can be appreciated, a PCM that undergoes a phase change can produce an increase in volume or pressure (e.g., in a phase change from a liquid to a solid, a solid to a gas, or a liquid to a gas) and any container housing such a PCM must be designed to take into account the increased volumes and pressures that would accompany such a phase change. In any of the embodiments described herein, a vent or pressure-relief valve can be installed in the container housing a PCM to relieve increases in pressure or volume.

US9537425,55,an impedance mismatch becomes a factor for increasing the reflection of a high-frequency signal and thereby deteriorating the high-frequency characteristics,conduction and switching losses incurred due to switching on of the parasitic diode are not as high as those incurred for conduction through a parasitic diode of a high voltage transistor,0.89,US09535213,G,US09537425,H,"As used herein, a ""high-voltage device"", such as a high-voltage transistor, is an electronic device which is optimized for high-voltage switching applications. That is, when the transistor is off, it is capable of blocking high voltages, such as about 300V or higher, about 600V or higher, about 1200V or higher, or about 1700V or higher, and when the transistor is on, it has a sufficiently low on-resistance (R
In the hybrid device of FIGS. 8A and 8B, while the high-voltage D-mode transistor 808 typically lacks a parasitic diode anti-parallel to the channel, the low-voltage E-mode transistor 809 may include an intrinsic parasitic anti-parallel diode. Or, an external diode can be connected anti-parallel to the channel. In the case where transistor 809 includes an intrinsic parasitic anti-parallel diode but without an external diode connected in parallel to the parasitic diode, hybrid device 807 operates as follows. In a first mode of operation, when voltage at the drain of the hybrid device (i.e., the drain of D-mode transistor 808) is higher than voltage at the source of the hybrid device (i.e., the source of E-mode transistor 809) and the gate of the hybrid device (i.e., the gate of E-mode transistor 809) is biased relative to the source at a voltage below the threshold voltage of E-mode transistor 809 (i.e., the gate is biased OFF), the hybrid device 807 blocks the drain-source voltage that is across the device. In this mode of operation, the drain source voltage may be as high as (Vs2)/2, and can be even higher immediately after switching due to ringing. In a second mode of operation, when voltage at the drain of the hybrid device is higher than voltage at the source of the hybrid device, and the gate of the hybrid device is biased relative to the source at a voltage above the threshold voltage of E-mode transistor 809 (i.e., the gate is biased ON), the hybrid device conducts substantial current from the drain of the hybrid device to the source of the hybrid device (i.e., in a first direction) through the channels of both transistors 808 and 809. In a third mode of operation, when voltage at the drain of the hybrid device is lower than voltage at the source of the hybrid device, and the gate is biased relative to the source at a voltage below the transistor threshold voltage (i.e., the gate is biased OFF), the hybrid device conducts substantial current from the source of the hybrid device to the drain of the hybrid device (i.e., in a second direction). In this mode of operation, the current conducts through the channel of D-mode transistor 808 and through the parasitic diode of E-mode transistor 809. Since E-mode transistor 809 is a low voltage device, conduction and switching losses incurred due to switching on of the parasitic diode are not as high as those incurred for conduction through a parasitic diode of a high voltage transistor. However, this third mode of operation can still result in conduction losses being too high, and so a fourth mode of operation can be achieved as follows. While the hybrid device is operated in the third mode of operation described above, the gate of the hybrid device is switched ON (i.e., to a voltage that is greater than the hybrid device threshold voltage relative to the voltage at its source). In this fourth mode of operation, current continues to flow through the channel of the D-mode transistor 808 in the second direction, but current in the E-mode transistor 809 flows through the transistor channel rather than through the parasitic diode. Hence, conduction losses are reduced relative to the third mode of operation.
In a hybrid device in which an external diode is connected anti-parallel to the channel, the external diode performs the same function as the parasitic diode in the four modes of operation described above.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

US9537514,103,markings applied to roadway pavements to guide traffic in construction type operations usually require a temporary existence,delta-sigma converters require large oversampling ratios in order to produce a sufficient number of bit-stream pulses for a given input,0.84,US09534150,E,US09537514,H,"FIG. 4 is a schematic diagram of a quantizer circuit 100 defined by one group of the ADCs 76 and the DACs 78. The ADC 76 and the DAC 78 include a bit path for each bit in the 4-bit quantizer. Each signal path in the ADC 76 includes a comparator 102 and a latch 104. A voltage divider network 106 sets a different reference voltage for each of the comparators 102 in each of the signal paths. The analog signal from the filter 74 is provided on line 108 and is sent to each of the comparators 102. If that voltage level is above the reference level for the particular comparator 102, then the latch 104 for that channel is set high for that bit. The DAC 78 includes latches 110 that reset the bits back to an analog signal through a switch 112.
Delta-sigma modulators are a well known class of devices for implementing analog-to-digital conversion. The fundamental properties that are exploited are oversampling and error feedback (delta) that is accumulated (sigma) to convert the desired signal into a pulse modulated stream that can subsequently be filtered to read off the digital values, while effectively reducing the noise via shaping. The key limitation of known delta-sigma modulators is the quantization noise in the pulse conversion process. Delta-sigma converters require large oversampling ratios in order to produce a sufficient number of bit-stream pulses for a given input. In direct-conversion schemes, the sampling ratio is greater than four times the RF carrier frequency to simplify digital filtering. Thus, required multi-GHz sampling rates have limited the use of delta-sigma modulators in higher frequency applications. Another way to reduce noise has been to use higher order delta-sigma modulators. However, while first order canonical delta-sigma architectures are stable, higher orders can be unstable, especially given the tolerances at higher frequencies. For these reasons, state of the art higher order delta-sigma modulators have been limited to audio frequency ranges, i.e., time interleaved delta-sigma modulators, for use in audio applications or specialized interleaving at high frequencies. The present invention improves upon prior approaches through the sixth-order filter 74 with the 4-bit feedback structure for maximum flexibility in the noise shaping characteristics. The modulators 52 can achieve a dynamic range of 100 dB over a signal bandwidth of 20 MHz across an RF bandwidth of 400 MHz.
A decoder 82 receives the 4-bit sequence from all of the ADCs 76 simultaneously and reconfigures the bits in the proper orientation to be output as a serial data stream. The bits are then provided to a de-multiplexer 84 to provide the data stream at the lower clock rate. Particularly, the output data bits from the ADCs 76 are decoded from thermometer code to binary code and de-multiplex down to a data rate that can be supported by the DSP 54. Operational parameters for the filter 74 are set by the DSP 54 and are provided on line 98. Also, a calibration phase is performed to optimize the performance for the receive channel 50. A clocking device 88 provides the clock signals to the various components in the modulator 52, as shown, where the frequency of the clock rate determines power consumption and semiconductor material as will be discussed in further detail below.","['that bit.

Thus, the DL-reference UL/DL configuration of the FDD SCell is UL/DL configuration with offset δ=1. In a second example b, the offset δ is 4 (if the offset 130 range is from 0 to 9) or −1 (if the offset 130 range is from −4 to 5). The overlapping UL forms a TDD UL/DL configuration 2 with no offset 130 (i.e., δ=0). Thus, the DL-reference UL/DL configuration of the FDD SCell is UL/DL configuration with no offset 130.
FIG. 12 illustrates an example of an FDD cell DL-reference configuration with a non-standard overlapping UL pattern. If the overlapping UL subframes form a pattern that is not a standard UL/DL configuration, the DL-reference UL/DL configuration should be selected from the existing 7 UL/DL configurations with less UL subframes than the overlapping UL subframes. In the example illustrated, the PCell used UL/DL configuration 1 and the FDD SCell is configured with UL/DL configuration 6 with an offset 130 of −1 (or an offset 130 of 9, depending on the offset 130 range method used). The overlapping UL may form a pattern that is not a standard UL/DL configuration. Thus, a standard UL/DL configuration with less UL subframes should be used as the DL-reference configuration. In this example, the UL/DL configuration 2 with no offset 130 is determined as the DL-reference configuration of the FDD SCell.

In TDD, the radio frames have to be tightly synchronized to avoid interference from different transmission directions from adjacent cells on the same frequency carrier.

US9537869,137,the upper limit thereof is not particularly limited,the app is not blocked,0.8,US09533891,C,US09537869,H,"In one embodiment, the device-provided location data and accuracy number (i.e., number of meters) can be visually represented by a point in the center of a circle, the radius of the circle being the accuracy value (e.g., 10 m, 100 m, etc.). Thus, as noted, location data may be a longitude and latitude decimal degree coordinate representing the center of a circle having a radius of 10 meters. In the next step, the security program filters out or discards any location data points that have an accuracy value or number greater than 10 meters (e.g., 100 m or 1000 m) indicating a lesser accuracy level. In this example, such data points do not meet the desired accuracy threshold (10 m) and are not used to determine whether a mobile device is within an authorized region.
Once the app receives location data in the form of a point and circle around it (i.e., data obtained from location service/GPG services on the device), in one embodiment, the app wrapping program determines whether any portion the circle is inside the authorized, defined region (in one embodiment, a rectangle or square, as defined by the IT administrator). If any area of the circle falls inside the authorized region, the app is not blocked. In this respect, the geo-fencing policy may be described as permissive or erring on the side of allowing use of the app. It tolerates the mobile device (i.e., theoretically, the point in the circle) being outside the authorized region so long as the accuracy value of the circle (the circle radius) is equal to or smaller than the accuracy level selected by the IT administrator (Fine, High, Medium, etc.). In this respect, the IT administrator is better off selecting a higher number (High, Medium, or Low), so the margin of error allows using the app if near (but outside) the authorized region. (Most mobile location services, whether GPS or cellular-based, will not claim to be more accurate than 10 meters.) As a result, if a mobile device is outside an authorized building, for example on a sidewalk, but within 10 meters of the outer boundary of the authorized building, the app will continue to execute. In most cases, barring high-security environments, this is desirable. Once the user moves the device more than 10 meters away from the boundary, the app will be blocked unless the IT administrator selects a less accurate level.
This more permissive embodiment may be desirable because the geo-fencing policy should not block an app from executing if the mobile device (user/employee) is anywhere within the authorized region. The user may be blocked if a ""restrictive"" embodiment is implemented in which the mobile device would not only have to be inside the authorized region but, in addition, while still inside the region, not closer than, e.g., 10 meters, from the boundary of the authorized region because then at least some of the surface area of the circle described above will be outside the authorized region and the app will be blocked.","['the side of allowing use of the app. It tolerates the mobile device (i.e., theoretically, the point in the circle)', 'the side of allowing use of the', 'the side of allowing use of the app. It tolerates the mobile', 'of allowing use of the app. It tolerates the mobile', 'of allowing use of the app. It tolerates the mobile device (i.e., theoretically, the point in the circle)', 'side of allowing use of the app. It tolerates the mobile device (i.e., theoretically, the point in the circle) being outside the authorized region so long as the accuracy value of the circle (the circle radius) is equal to or smaller than the accuracy level selected by the IT administrator (Fine,', 'side of allowing use of the app. It tolerates the mobile device (i.e., theoretically, the', 'of allowing use of the app. It tolerates the mobile device (i.e., theoretically, the', 'respect,']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

US9538067,0,in addition to the increasing numbers of optical fibers,detection of a phase difference in a direction perpendicular to the center of the optical axis does less damage the light amount balance,0.85,US09534982,G,US09538067,H,"Referring to FIG. 14, descriptions below will focus on different arrangement of a focus area for horizontal and vertical detection from that of FIG. 13. As shown in FIG. 13, a focus area may be set based on only phase difference correlation calculation. However, based on conditions of an image pickup lens, a light amount balance between the L column and R column may be significantly damaged in terms of phase difference detection. Particularly, if a location of the pupil of the image pickup lens is too close to, or too far from, an imaging device, it becomes difficult to correct the light amount balance, such as an area from which phase difference may not be detected even when light balance correction, shading correction, vignetting correction, etc., are performed.
A condition and/or a state of the image pickup lens is determined based on a distance from the center of the optical axis of the image pickup lens. Detection of a phase difference in a direction perpendicular to the center of the optical axis does less damage the light amount balance. Vertical phase difference detection is arranged at a location horizontally apart from the center of the optical axis, whereas horizontal phase difference detection is arranged at a location vertically apart from the center of the optical axis. In other words, the horizontal phase difference may be detected within the horizontal phase difference focus area 205, which may also be referred to as a range 205. A horizontal range exceeding the range 205 is used as the area 206, which may also be referred to as a horizontal phase difference detecting range 206. The same applies to the vertical direction. An area capable of detecting phase differences in horizontal and vertical directions becomes a cross area, wherein lengths in horizontal directions are identical to lengths in vertical directions.

As shown in FIG. 13, a focus area may be set based on only phase difference correlation calculation. However, based on conditions of an image pickup lens, a light amount balance between the L column and R column may be significantly damaged in terms of phase difference detection. Particularly, if a location of the pupil of the image pickup lens is too close to, or too far from, an imaging device, it becomes difficult to correct the light amount balance, such as an area from which phase difference may not be detected even when light balance correction, shading correction, vignetting correction, etc., are performed.
A condition and/or a state of the image pickup lens is determined based on a distance from the center of the optical axis of the image pickup lens. Detection of a phase difference in a direction perpendicular to the center of the optical axis does less damage the light amount balance. Vertical phase difference detection is arranged at a location horizontally apart from the center of the optical axis, whereas horizontal phase difference detection is arranged at a location vertically apart from the center of the optical axis. In other words, the horizontal phase difference may be detected within the horizontal phase difference focus area 205, which may also be referred to as a range 205. A horizontal range exceeding the range 205 is used as the area 206, which may also be referred to as a horizontal phase difference detecting range 206. The same applies to the vertical direction. An area capable of detecting phase differences in horizontal and vertical directions becomes a cross area, wherein lengths in horizontal directions are identical to lengths in vertical directions. The area becomes the cross phase difference focus area 201. In the same regard, FIG. 14 shows that the vertical phase difference focus area 203 is horizontally arranged around the cross phase difference focus area 201, and the horizontal phase difference focus areas 202 are vertically arranged around the cross phase difference focus area 201.

As discussed, however, stereo imaging might not be available on all devices, or may not be sufficient for all conditions. For example, stereo imaging typically requires a minimum amount of contrast in order to be able to correlate the objects in the images captured from each camera. Accordingly, approaches in accordance with various embodiments can utilize different approaches, and/or a combination of approaches, to provide distance determinations useful in separating foreground objects from background objects. For example, a computing device might use a light sensor or other such component to determine an amount of light and/or image contrast near the computing device. If a sufficient amount of contrast is present, the device can utilize a stereo imaging approach. If there is not a sufficient amount of contrast, however, the device can attempt to use an alternative (or additional) approach to making distance determinations. If stereo imaging is not available, the device might instead rely on such an approach.
For example, a device can utilize infrared radiation (IR) to attempt to separate foreground objects from background objects in at least some embodiments, where the device can capture one image while emitting JR radiation and another image without IR radiation. Objects in the foreground will show stronger differences as a result of the illumination between figures, which can facilitate the identification of foreground objects. In other embodiments, a single image can be captured and the relative brightness of objects used to separate objects into foreground and background objects or regions, although a single image may not be as reliable as intensity differences can also vary based on color, surface texture, reflectivity, and other such factors. Multi-image based IR-based approaches can suffer from motion effects, however, as the images are captured at different points in time. Stereo imaging captures image information at the same time, such that there is little to no effect due to motion, other than blur or other such effects. IR-based approaches can produce relatively crisp images, even when there is an amount of motion, but do not work well in bright sunlight, where stereo imaging tends to perform well. IR-based approaches work well up to thirty centimeters, for example, but stereo approaches work for longer distances, such as up to three meters, but have blind zones when very close to the device. Stereo and IR based approaches thus complement each other, and can be used together advantageously in at least some embodiments for at least a certain range of conditions. Thus, a device can attempt to determine one or more environmental conditions, such as an amount of light or motion, and can select to use a stereo based approach or an IR based approach, or a combination of both. An advantage to using a combination of approaches is that each individual approach might only give a result with 80% confidence, but using them together can result in a confidence of about 96 percent in at least some embodiments.","['a sufficient amount of contrast,', 'sufficient amount of contrast,', 'sufficient amount of', 'sufficient amount of contrast, however, the device can attempt to use an', 'amount of contrast, however, the device can attempt to use an', 'amount of contrast, however, the device can attempt to use an alternative']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Referring to FIGS. 8 through 14C, the photo gate control signals (e.g., PG1_A through PGn_A) include random PVT noise according to the PVT conditions between the photo gate controller 40 and the photo gate driver 60, as described above with reference to FIG. 10.
Referring to FIG. 14A, the photo gate control signals PG1 through PGn include random noise from the first row to the n-th row. When the photo gate control signals PG1 through PGn having the random noise are input to the pixel array 24, it is very difficult to correct the noise in the pixel array 24. As a result, the quality of the depth image data IDATA_D is decreased.
FIG. 14B illustrates noise occurring in the rows when the phase matching block 66 illustrated in FIG. 8 generates and applies the matching photo gate control signals PGM1 through PGMn to the pixel array 24. Ideally, it is expected that there is no phase-skew due to the phase matching block 66 using the source clock signal CK_SRC. However, when the source clock signal CK_SRC is applied in the A direction, the source clock signal CK_SRC received by a D flip-flop 67 receiving the photo gate control signal PG1 may have a lower level than the source clock signal CK_SRC received by a D flip-flop 67 receiving the photo gate control signal PGn because of resistance components in a path through which the source clock signal CK_SRC passes. This causes noise to occur in the A direction, as shown in FIG. 14B. However, unlike the random noise illustrated in FIG. 14A, the noise occurs linearly along the A direction, and therefore, the ISP 200 can easily correct the noise.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With this arrangement, the most satisfactory phase condition between the wireless communication apparatus and the household electrical appliance n can be extracted. By executing Step 301 to Step 308 to all the household electrical appliances (all n), the phase information table of FIG. 2A can be obtained.
As shown in FIG. 2B or FIG. 2C, it is also effective to have a plurality of candidates of phase information to each household electrical appliance. FIG. 2B can be prepared by also storing the setting values of the variable phase shifting unit 3 at the time of second (phase information 2) and third (phase information 3) highest reception levels, not only by storing the setting value (phase information 1) of the variable phase shifting unit 3 at the time of the highest reception level in Step 308 in FIG. 3. Due to the change under the environment at the actual application time, there is a case where the reception probability becomes higher by setting the variable phase shifting unit 3 based on the phase information on the second (φ12 in the household electrical appliance 1) or third (φ13 in the household electrical appliance 1) highest reception level. In such a case, in the actual communications, in the household electrical appliance 1, first, the communications are started under the phase condition φ11 in which the reception level is the highest. In the case of performing a retransmission due to the occurrence of a communication error (for example, when a reception confirmation signal has not reached from the household electrical appliance as the transmitting destination), communications are performed under the phase condition φ12. When a communication error further occurs despite the retransmission, communications are performed under the phase condition φ13.
On the other hand, FIG. 2C does not have the phase information 2 and the phase information 3 in absolute values like in FIG. 2B, but has a configuration that has the phase information 2 and the phase information 3 in relative values. Phase difference information in FIG. 2C is a value obtained by subtracting the phase information 1 from the phase information 2 in FIG. 2B, for example (for example, in the household electrical appliance 1, dφ1=φ12−φ11). In the case of communicating by changing the phase condition at a retransmission time due to a communication error, the variable phase shifting unit 3 is changed by integer times of dφ1, for example. By controlling in this way, the phase-information table storage unit 8 is not required to store much phase information, and the memory can be saved. Further, based on the characteristics of the antenna, when proper phase-difference information is known in advance, phase difference information is not required to be obtained again. For example, it is useful to set the phase difference information as information that is equivalent to the phase of the variable phase shifting unit 3 which is changed by 45 degrees.","['household electrical appliance.

The error may include, for example, a root mean square error, an ordinary least square error, an Akaike information criterion error, a least absolute deviations error, or the like.

US9538540,165,the following preparation examples are illustrative purpose only and the disclosure is not limited to the preparation examples,the network will grant transmission to the ue only if the ue is not barred from sending sr/bsr,0.8,US09534316,C,US09538540,H,"FIG. 5 illustrates a method of smart congestion control for a UE in RRC Idle mode. The UE comprises a NAS layer and an AS layer. When MMTEL service arrives from the NAS layer, the NAS layer performs SSAC check to verify if the UE is barred from NAS layer access. After satisfying the SSAC check, NAS layer notifies AS layer that a service is arrived and an RRC connection is required. Afterwards, the AS layer further performs ACB check to verify if the UE is barred from AS layer access. On the other hand, for other mobile originated (MO) data service such as FTP, there is no NAS layer access control, and NAS layer could directly notify AS layer that service request and only AS layer ACB check is performed for MO data service. Therefore, the traditional double barring for MMTEL service de-prioritizes MMTEL service. In accordance with one novel aspect, the AS layer performs selective ACB. With selective ACB, the ACB check may be bypassed for MMTEL service if configured by the network. This way, MMTEL service is not always de-prioritized. Instead, MMTEL service can be prioritized through bypassing ACB check in AS layer. After the UE passes the AS layer access control, the UE starts a contention-based random access (RA) procedure with a backoff window to gain access to the radio network. In accordance with another novel aspect, the RA backoff value is prioritized based on traffic type. Different backoff values are used for different traffic types. After completing the RA procedure, the UE establishes an RRC connection with the network and enters RRC Connected mode.
FIG. 6 illustrates a method of smart congestion control in RRC Connected mode. After the UE establishes an RRC connection for the application, the specific application is associated with a certain QoS class indicator (QCI) respectively. For example, there are total nine (9) QCIs, and each QCI is then mapped to a corresponding logical channel group (LCG). The MMTEL service may be associated with QCI1, while the MO data service may be associated with QCI5 (the default QCI). In accordance with one novel aspect, additional barring control may be applied for the subscribed applications, which have different prioritizations (e.g., based on QCI). Different prioritization have different barring parameters for the UE to decide whether scheduling request (SR) and buffer status report (BSR) can be sent. The network will grant transmission to the UE only if the UE is not barred from sending SR/BSR.
For a UE to perform selective ACB, the network (eNB) needs to indicate the bypass of ACB to the UE. In a first embodiment, the eNB uses a new information bit in SIB. The new information bit indicates whether ACB bypass should be applied for MMTEL service. In a second embodiment, the eNB changes the existing SSAC parameter, e.g., adding one bit to indicate whether ACB bypass should be applied for MMTEL service. In a third embodiment, a predefined ACB barring value is used to implicitly indicate whether ACB bypass should be applied for MMTEL service. In a fourth embodiment, separate new information bits in SIB are used for individual MMTEL service subtypes including voice, video, and text. For example, three new information bits are defined in SIB, and each bit indicates whether ACB bypass should be applied for MMTEL voice, video, and text service respectively.","['the AS layer performs selective ACB.', 'the AS layer performs selective ACB.

At block 1704, the first device detects that a radio connection to the second device has been lost. In some embodiments, the first device determines that the connection is lost if a radio signal is no longer detected from the second device. In some embodiments, the first device monitors the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) of the radio signal from the second device. If the RSSI drops below a preset threshold, the first device determines that the connection is lost. At block 1706, the first device automatically dials the first phone number in response to detecting the loss of connection.
At block 1708, the second device associates a second phone number with the first device. At block 1710, the phone call from the first device is received. At block 1712, the second device compares the number of the call to the second phone number that is associated with the first device. The number of the call can be determined, for example, using caller identification. If the number of the call does not match the second phone number, the call is rejected at block 1714. If the number of the call matches the second phone number, the call is automatically answered at block 1716. In some embodiments, a user of the second device is given a prompt to answer the call. Checking the number of the call before answering ensures that communication is established with the proper party. For example, if the user of the second device is in a tactical situation, it would be undesirable for the second device to automatically answer a call from an unwanted party, such as the user's friend or spouse.
In some embodiments, the auto-dial functionality is be implemented on a slave device, such that the slave device calls a master device (and/or another slave device) when connection is lost. Furthermore, the auto-dial functionality can be used to maintain communication between two or more wireless-conferencing groups. For example, if a first master device of a first group loses radio connection to a second master device of a second group, one of the master devices can automatically dial the other. Additionally, more than one phone number can be associated with each radio, and a priority can be established between the phone numbers such that if a call cannot be established with a first number, a second number is dialed, then a third number, etc. Priority can also be established between radios. For example, if a radio communication group includes three devices besides the radio (one master device and two slave devices) the priority list can specify that the master device is dialed first, then the first slave, and then the second slave if radio connection is lost with the group. In some embodiments, a heartbeat signal (e.g., a periodic ping) is used to determine if communication is lost.

Further, in the case of the series of electronic components described in JP 10-338208 A, it is necessary to employ, as a package tape, a cardboard base material which has one main surface maintained to be flat and, further, has the other main surface provided with concave portions. However, it should be noted that there are constraints on paper materials which enable such processing, thereby inducing the problem of larger material costs.
